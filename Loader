# Loader
# 
# This file will load the settings specified in the configuration file and
# prepare the running of all the tasks associated to those settings. This
# includes the creation of provision-pre.sh and provision-post.sh, the auto
# configuration of bash tasks, synchronization of shared folders, and fixes for
# some problems that may appear on Windows based hosts systems and Ubuntu based
# guest systems.

# Change Encoding to Unicode
#
# Ruby may have problems parsing paths containing special characters, so many
# load and require commands will fail. This little snippet seems to fix that
# problem by changing the default encoding for command line to UTF-8.

# 
# Avoid "stdin: not a tty" error in Ubuntu 12.04. This may need to be something
# different in other systems.

#

# tasks and create the provision-pre.sh and provision-post.sh files needed in
# order to perform those tasks. Provision will not run if Lockfile exists.
